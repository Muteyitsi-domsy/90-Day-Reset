### Important AI Disclaimer

The App uses Google Gemini AI to analyze your journal entries and generate insights, reports, summaries, and prompts.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: AI CAN MAKE MISTAKES AND IS NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE**

**You expressly acknowledge and agree that:**

1. **AI Technology Limitations** - Artificial intelligence technology, including Google Gemini AI, is not infallible. AI-generated content may contain errors, inaccuracies, omissions, or inappropriate suggestions.

2. **No Guarantee of Accuracy** - We make NO guarantees regarding the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or appropriateness of any AI-generated content, including but not limited to:
   - Journal insights and reflections
   - Weekly and monthly reports
   - Pattern detection and analysis
   - Mood interpretations
   - Suggested prompts and recommendations

3. **Verification Required** - You must independently verify any information, insights, patterns, or suggestions provided by AI features before relying on them. AI-generated reports should NOT be used as the sole basis for any important personal, health, or life decisions.

4. **Not Professional Advice** - AI-generated content is NOT:
   - Medical advice or diagnosis
   - Psychological or psychiatric advice
   - Therapeutic treatment or counseling
   - Professional advice of any kind

5. **Interpretation Errors** - AI may misinterpret:

4. Your content is not used for AI model training

**Privacy:** See our Privacy Policy for details on how journal data is handled during AI analysis.

### Disclaimer of Warranty for AI Content

**AI-GENERATED CONTENT IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

## Crisis Detection and Mental Health Resources

### Automated Crisis Detection

The App includes automated crisis detection that analyzes your journal entries for concerning language patterns such as:
- Suicidal ideation
